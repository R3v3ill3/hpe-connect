/*
  # Fix RLS Policies and Triggers

  This migration fixes the RLS policies and trigger functions that were causing the
  "missing FROM-clause entry for table new" error.

  1. Changes
    - Drops and recreates problematic policies with proper NEW record handling
    - Updates trigger functions to use proper error handling
    - Fixes policy definitions to avoid NEW table references
    - Adds proper CASCADE options for cleanup

  2. Security
    - Maintains existing security model
    - Ensures proper access control
    - Preserves data integrity
